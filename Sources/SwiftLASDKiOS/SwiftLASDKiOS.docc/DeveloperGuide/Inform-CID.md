# Informing the Agent of the Correlation ID

**CBA Live Assist** gives some help to the application in informing the agent of the correlation ID; it can create a **short code** and associate it with the correlation ID when it creates the session, and the client can send the short code out-of-band to the agent:

The advantage of communicating a short code, rather than communicating the correlation ID directly, is that the short code generated by the **CBA Live Assist** server is guaranteed to be both unique during the communication process, and short enough for the client to communicate by voice (or whatever other out-of-band communication channel is in use) without error.
**Note:**
  - The short code expires 5 minutes after creation; it should therefore be used as soon as possible after being created.

  - Once a short code has been used by both agent and consumer to communicate a correlation ID, it is discarded, and may be used by a different agent and consumer to communicate a different correlation ID.

### Including a Second Agent

There is a second scenario in which the short code REST service can be used when there is no existing call between the two parties. If an agent is in a co-browse session with a consumer and wishes to include a second agent in the same co-browse session, the agent already knows the correlation ID of the **CBA Live Assist** session, and can use it in the initial call to the REST service, to associate that correlation ID with a newly created short code:

The second agent application uses the short code in exactly the same way as before to connect to the same co-browse session as the first agent and the consumer.
