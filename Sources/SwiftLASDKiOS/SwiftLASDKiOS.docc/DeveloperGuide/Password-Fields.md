# Password Fields

When entering a password into a text field on an iOS device, it briefly displays the character that has been entered before masking it. As a userâ€™s device screen is being replicated and displayed to an agent, the agent may be able to see the password as it is being entered. Consequently, we recommend that you mask fields that can contain sensitive information using the built-in masking capabilities provided by the **CBA Live Assist SDK** (see the <doc:Permissions> section).
