# Alerts and System Dialog Boxes

Due to limitations imposed by iOS, **CBA Live Assist** cannot replicate any iOS-generated dialog boxes, such as Alert boxes, the iOS keyboard, or menus generated by HTML (for example, the popup menu generated by the HTML \<select\> element), to the agent. Instead, consider alternative implementations, such as JavaScript and CSS.
