# Snapshots

iOS devices have a feature called **Snapshot**, which allows the user to take a screenshot and share it. If the consumer takes a screenshot and shares it (using the **Use Photo** button, or similar), the agent receives a notification from the **CBA Live Assist Agent SDK** (see the ***CBA Live Assist Agent Console Developer Guide***).

**Note:** This is not strictly a **CBA Live Assist iOS SDK** feature, as doing it needs no interaction with the **CBA Live Assist iOS SDK** (apart from calling startSupport). However, developers should be aware of it.
